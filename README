Program that simulates a Schwinger model on a lattice with a pure gauge action, and measures the plaquette value using an heat bath algorithm.

make default, to run the program with a Metropolis-Hastings step and the gsl default random generator.
make metropolis, to use instead a simpler Metropolis algorithm
make stdlib, to use instead rand() from stdlib
