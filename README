Program that simulates a Schwinger model on a lattice with a pure gauge action with torus and moebius boundaries.

Computing the plaquette mean value:
make runPlaquette, to compute plaquette mean value in both boundaries.

Computing the topological charge infinite volume and continuum limit:
make runCharge
For plotting theese results:
make plotCharge

See factSheet.pdf for more informations about the heat bath algorithm I used.
