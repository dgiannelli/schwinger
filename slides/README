GSP 2016 Presentation
-----------------------------------------------

The presentation template uses the externalize feature of tikz. Hence,
the Makefile tries to compile only the minimal changeset of your
document. All figures within a "tikzpicture" are cached in the
"cache" directory. The generated pdfs only change when you change
something in these pictures. This process should happen automatically.

A simple "make" should capture this. There is basically no need to
call "make clean" or even "make distclean".

-----------------------------------------------
GSP 2016 Presentation Repository
-----------------------------------------------

The presentation can be cloned via

git clone git@gsp.fz-juelich.de:2016/presentation-f.lastname

(Adjust <f.lastname> accordingly, you have read permissions on all student's
repositories, and write permissions on your own.)

First, we need to update the texmf repo

 make update-texmf

To compile the presentation please type

 make


To clean up before committing or adding to the git repo please call

 make clean


To really clean up (also remove generated tikz externalize files in the cache folder)

 make distclean


The document structure is closely related to the report. The file that gets compiled is named

 f.lastname-presentation.tex


Lualatex will compile this file into a pdf named

 f.lastname-presentation.pdf


If you want to add more files or change files, please honor the following rules

1.) Do not change the f.lastname-presentation.tex file at all. All changes you perform there I will not see.
2.) Do not change/modify/alter the packages.d/ and config.d/ directories and files
3.) Do not change/modify/alter the packages.tex and config.tex files

4.) If you need to add configuration for certain packages, please use the config.local.tex file
5.) If you need to add packages (please don't), use packages.local.tex


-----------------------------------------------
General Rule
-----------------------------------------------

1.) You can change/modify all files in directories starting with a capital letter, like Figures/Images/Data
2.) Please do not modify any files in folders in lower case like scripts/packages.d/config.d/

The title and abstract should go into title.tex
The introduction should go into the introduction.tex
The outlook should go ... well you know ...
