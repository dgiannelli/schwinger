Program that simulates a Schwinger model on a lattice with a pure gauge action.

Computing the plaquette mean value:
make plaquette, to run the program with a Metropolis-Hastings step and the gsl default random generator.
make plaquetteMetropolis, to use instead a simpler Metropolis algorithm
make plaquetteStdlib, to use instead rand() from stdlib

Computing the topological charge and plotting the results:
make charge

See factSheet.pdf for more informations about the heat bath algorithm I used.
